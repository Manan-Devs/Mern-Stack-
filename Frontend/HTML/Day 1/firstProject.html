<h2>Who is a Frontend Developer?</h2>

<p>A Frontend Developer is a programmer who builds the visual and interactive parts of a website or web application that users see and use directly. They work with technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive, user-friendly, and attractive interfaces.</p>

<p>Their main responsibility is to make websites responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing across different devices like mobiles, tablets, and desktops. Frontend developers often work closely with UI/UX designers to turn creative designs into working web pages that are fast, accessible, and engaging. They also use modern frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.js, along with tools like Git, npm, and browser dev tools, to improve efficiency and maintain code. In short, a frontend developer acts as the bridge between design and technology, ensuring users have a smooth and enjoyable online experience.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Becoming a Frontend Developer</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Start with HTML & CSS (foundation).

Cover ES6+ features, DOM manipulation, events, fetch/async-await, and basic data structuresâ€”these make your pages interactive.</li>
  <li>Get comfortable with tooling & version control.
Use Git/GitHub, the browser devtools, npm (or yarn), and a code editor (VS Code). Learn basic debugging, building, and package usage.</li>
  <li>Pick a modern framework/library.
Learn React (or Vue/Angular): components, state, props, hooks, and routing. Build a few small apps to understand the component-driven workflow.</li>
  <li>Build projects, create a portfolio, and deploy.
Make 3 - 6 real projects (personal site, todo app, API-driven weather app, responsive landing page), host them (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel), write READMEs, and practice interviews/applications. Keep improving with accessibility, performance, and testing.</li>
